"QUANTUM SHOT" #761
Link - article by Avi Abrams      Not quite "Stairways to Heaven", but totally unique and extremely stylish structures nonetheless
There are other compilations of unique shelf designs, as we are in no way alone in liking visually outstanding and effective ideas in interior design - but bookshelves hold a special place in our hearts... oh, such a special place! First of all, they contain books, a deeply comforting amount of books that we will never be able to read in its entirety in our lifetimes.(images via 1, 2; bottom right is the "Coiled Serpent Book" - more info)
Second, it is one of the very first desires of human spirit to climb the "stairs" and reach the unattainable (or lost) kind of Paradise, so called "inner peace" - starting all the way from Tower of Babel, and continuing through Jacob's Ladder to our current fascination with "skyscrapers": in every case, there is a sort of stepped structure (filled with knowledge at every level) which ultimately leads to inner satisfaction, or so the story goes. The "stairs and ladders" part of this sentiment we will cover in the next article, but today we'll see some lovely stacked bookshelves and some inspiring home library set ups.(more info - Sebastian Errazuriz Ivy shelves, Books with legs and arms (made with bent nails), Circular Moving Bookshelf)
Book shelves, book cases and library stands satisfy on many levels: they contain loads of potentially fascinating knowledge, and they beckon by their very presence to come and partake of their contained wisdom - and be inspired by their fantastic forms in the process. "Fantastic forms", that is, if we consider some of the spectacular designs presented on these pages. The Most Amazing Reading Adventures: Starring the Most Amazing Bookshelves!
Perhaps not very practical, but totally radical and great in every art studio is this Neverending shelving unit from Luca Nichetto:(image credit: Luca Nichetto)
Fabulous shapes of every color and persuasion:(more info - USA map, Spiral, and Wavy bookshelves)(more info - Diagonal units, FlexiTube round units and a Shelf Tree)(more info - Bookshelves with a bench, Ellipse book case, and Saba Italia bookcases)(more info - Round Shelf by Irina Zhdanova, Genetics Bookcase by MYDNA)(more info - Second a Half Dimension book shelf at lower right)
Some of the more radical ideas of storing books can be seen here:(more info - The Brace Case, and Hanging Bookshelf)
I personally love this Sphere Bookcase (more info):(images via)
Russian Constructivism design on the right, and the Sean Yoo's Opus Shelving:(images via 1, 2)Pulseline, Inverted Shelf which you can make yourself (left) and Pin Press (right) - more info:(images via)
Why just set books straight on the shelf? Here is a bold idea: hang them! and preserve the place you're reading, turning book shelf essentially into a bookmark (more info):(images via 1, 2)
On the left image above is the "Equilibrium" set up, and on the right is another hanging idea, this time from Frankfurt, called "Book Wave".
The idea of infinity of books is conveyed nicely in these creations: "Eternity" in the library of Melk monastery in Austria... and the inside of a "Book Cell" sculpture by Matej Kren: (images credit: Cilest, http://www.matejkren.cz/cs/book-cell/, via)
Same "book tunnel" idea can be seen here (on the right is the famous project in the Prague Library, where they used mirrors to achieve this effect):(image credit: Petr Kratochvil)
The famous book staircase features awesome views from every angle - more info:(images via)
And... if you are really proud of your books, then display them OUTSIDE, for all neighborhood to see (just kidding, this is a street art):(images credit: Andre)Optical Illusion Bookshelves
This mind-bending bookshelf is based on the "Impossible Fork" illusion 9see on the image below right). It's been designed by John Leung from ClarkeHopkinsClarke Architects- and fittingly called the “Bias of Thoughts”(image credit: ClarkeHopkinsClarke Architects)
"How many shelves are there? Look to the left: four shelves. Look to the right: three shelves." Neatorama has more images and optical illusion explanation.
Not really an optical illusion (and not really a book shelf) but still a puzzling apparition, is this recursive design by Markus Hoffer:(left image via, right photo manipulation via)"Read your bookshelf!"
This is a sort of a puzzle (if you look closely and see how the shelves are arranged) - but extremely satisfying once you start to read through each and every compartment:(image credit: Arredamenti Saporiti)
Designed by Arredamenti Saporiti: it can also contain a hidden message... or not:(images credit: Arredamenti Saporiti)
Love some weird fiction, or a healthy doze of Lovecraft stories? Then try this Fungi Shelf by Katharina Mischer:(images credit: Katharina Mischer)Reading Nooks &amp; Hideouts
Here is a nook that we all would like to cuddle inside, with a good book:(images via 1, 2)
The lovely kid's reading corner in the right image above is done by Thrifty Decor Chick, where you can find the detailed instructions how to make it yourself. Below you can see the The Cave Bookshelf, designed by Sakura Adachi:(images credit: Sakura Adachi)
Here's a couple of great reading nooks that fit perfectly into the existing interior design of your house. Find that extra-space under stairs, or at windowsills - and use it! -(images via 1, 2)
Help! My books are sinking! -(image credit: Raw Edges)A Wild, Wild Shelf Space
A cube? A book cube! - A Bibliochaise Book Shelf Chair:(images via)
The bottom right image above is another "book chair" that you can order here. Love book chair idea? Makes sense for those who want to keep their library close to their reading space... here are some more designs like this:(images via 1, 2, the recycled book sconce light is via)
... and a few not as functional designs - rather sculptures, good perhaps for your living space visual appeal:(images via)
Books themselves can become shelves sticking out of the wall (order here), or be used as library furniture (oh, blasphemy!):(images via 1, 2)Things organized neatly
First, you have to weigh in your "READ" pile vs. "UNREAD" pile... and decide is it even possible to catch up? - Bookshelf by Niko Economids. If you have a bunch of books "unread", then it is easier just to hang them from the ceiling (just like on the image far right) than to go ahead and read them:(images via)
By now, you all probably have seen the Rainbow Bookshef? if not, here it is, in all its obsessive-compulsive organizing glory:(image via)
You can observe great shelf organizing in action in a video here
Here is an example of a total fail in organizing your reading/working space (some of these, we have to say, have been done "on purpose"):(images via)
Some bizarre shapes seem to crop up every time, with some presenting quite a challenge in fitting with the rest of your furniture. Here is a "wisdom Tree" by Spanish designer Jordi Mila(images credit Jordi Mila, Barcelona)
If you run out of space in your existing bookshelves, then... just stretch them! -(left image via)
On the right image above is the "The Myth of Sisyphus" design by Bruno Petronzi. And for more neatness in organizing things check out this Tumbler site
Finally, here is a fun question, can you tell which image is real and which has been Photoshopped? -
Well, obviously, the one with books bent all out of whack is Photoshop. That was easy. On the left, by the way, is the gorgeous Italian Sherwood Bookcase, which is a clear winner in our books.
For further inspiration and hours of browsing, we invite you to visit Bookshelf Porn website (which has nothing to do with porn, of course, and plenty to offer a curious booklover). In the next article in the series we will highlight some stairs and ladders that will lead to... more bookshelves, filled in turn with... more books, containing in turn more knowledge... well, you get the idea.READ MORE OF OUR "GADGETS" CATEGORY -&gt;CHECK OUT OUR "EXTREE ARCHITECTURE" SERIES! -&gt;

"QUANTUM SHOT" #560 
Link - article by Avi Abrams      Lovely, slender, pure white shapes of old churches and palaces - arching into the sky and into your heart
Old Russian architecture is still largely unknown in the West, if you consider that most people are only aware of the Kremlin and maybe one or two key churches in major towns. But the land that accepted Byzantine Christianity back in 988 AD - and produced mighty works of divine architecture and art in the centuries since - is unimaginably vast. Once you decide to venture into pastoral and often bleak small towns and Russian countryside, there is a good chance that architectural gems and religious art masterpieces hidden there "in the rough" will be totally unknown to most people. And yet, the pure, inspired, and rich legacy of the first Russian builders is worth discovery and, after you've been enchanted, further exploration.
In our first part we saw the "magical" wooden palace that's been recently restored in Moscow. Today we are going to highlight significantly less known (but no less beautiful) structures in Russian small towns... but we'll start with a true Baroque skyscraper, if there ever was one!This slender bell tower could've been the Highest Building in Europe, back in 1750
You're looking at the model of the Smolny Convent in St. Petersburg (it was only partially built, without the incredible bell tower). The Italian-born architect Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli lived and worked in Russia during the reign of Elizabeth - and he had a vision to create something epic and undoubtedly special: a bell tower 140 meters tall with five distinct levels that would be taller than anything in Europe at the time!(image via, click to enlarge)
Rastrelli's work was so ephemeral and ornate (he preferred to build in the style of Late Baroque, described as "sumptuous and majestic") that other architects humbly accepted the Smolny Convent as a "way how the REAL divine architecture should look" - never mind that the ambitious bell tower was not finished...
Some sources state that Elizabeth's death in 1762 prevented Rastrelli from completing this grand design (Catherine the Great favored Neo-Classical style instead); other sources insist that it was ultimately Rastrelli's decision to abandon the construction. Perhaps, he realized that the bell tower was too dominating and overpowering the whole Convent arrangement?
In any case, even without the huge bell tower, today the Smolny Convent shines delicately in the night, a true jewel of St. Peterburg's architecture:(image via)The ancient city of Kolomna

Part of Russia's "Golden Ring" and first chronicled in 1024, Suzdal "once had 40 churches for 400 families". The compact Suzdal-Vladimir area contains 5 monasteries, 36 churches and 15 bell towers.
Here is the Cathedral of the Dormition in the ancient city of Vladimir: the blessed purity of white, the inspiration of pure faith:(image credit: Viktor Galkin)The Ancient City of Murom: Birthplace of a true Russian superhero
We are talking about Iliya Muromets, the ancient and all-powerful warrior and good-hearted "saviour" (bogatyr) who featured prominently in ancient Russian literature and magical fairy tales (together with even more powerful "elemental" mountain-like giant Svyatogor):(top right: "Bogatyrs" painting (1898) by Viktor Vasnetsov; images via 1, 2)

Near Murom, another old town of Uglich is famous for having the best cheese in Russia... Crossing over from Russia to Western Ukraine, some intensely romantic views can also be found, like this photo of the Kamenets-Podolski monastery:(image credit: Yury Gulyaev)
Many local churches are being restored in small towns all over Russia today, but also many old-style typical log houses get a fresh layer of paint:(image credit: sergefromru)
Finishing our review of wonders in obscure Russian small towns and countryside, here is a whimsical old-style motion wooden toy from Bogorodskoye village... with a definitely modern touch! -(images credit: Evgeniy Kucherov, 2)

"QUANTUM SHOT" #196
Link - article by Avi AbramsFluid dynamics, turbulence, refraction combine to create spectacular sky shows!
More and more high-altitude vapour trails appear in our skies as the flight density of commercial aviation increases. These trails often follow the plane straight and narrow, then degrade into fuzzy and fanciful formations, blending with clouds and leaving a subtle afterimage in our subconscious. We almost do not notice them any more! But as the following photos show, sometimes a simple condensation trail from a jet engine can be worth a second glance.(images via 1, 2)
There are four aircraft in this picture, "dominated by the A330 in front and its huge contrail":(image credit: Bailey, AirTeamImages)
Contrails, also called "Vapor Trails", are usually forming at high altitudes and consist of tiny ice crystals, or water droplets. The sort of contrails generated by engine exhaust would, of course, contribute to pollution (here is an interesting discussion on the topic), but the visible white streams in the sky (often combined with airplane's "wingtip vortices") are essentially ice crystals and pure condensation trails. "Being composed of water, they are not, in and of themselves, air pollution."(images credit: Laurent Malbecq, 2)
Contrails tell the story: here USAF F-15 Eagle Fighters intercept two Soviet MiG-29 fighters:(image credit: Staff Sgt. Kevin L. Bishop, USAF)

Heavenly Highways! -(image via)The Opposite of Contrails
when the jet passes through a cloud, it is the absence of the trail (so called "distrail") that becomes visible - as the plane clears its way through the cloud, the turbulence and freezing of supercooled water droplets cause elongated trails, stretching for dozens of kilometers and even visible from space:(images credit: NASA, via)
"As an aircraft passes through the supercooled clouds (supercooled clouds contain water droplets that remain liquid even though the temperature is well below freezing), tiny particles in the exhaust come into contact with the supercooled water droplets, which freeze instantly. The larger ice crystals fall out of the cloud deck, leaving behind the "holes", while the tiniest ice particles in the center remain aloft." - more infoPropeller tip vortices swirl around the fuselage...
There are other types of contrails besides those from the engine exhaust. Our reader writes: "I've seen and taken pictures of propeller-driven aircraft with contrails forming off the prop tips and wrapping themselves around the fuselage and nacelles of the aircraft for five or six spirals from the front of the aircraft/nacelle. This is usually in high ambient temperature/high humidity conditions."
Propeller vortices could be just as interesting visually as wingtip vortices, but they're harder to spot and rare to occur: in this case they are clearly seen around the Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 Hercules C4:(image credit: Sven De Bevere)Breaking the Sound Barrier: Transonic Cloud Effects
Going over the sound barrier leads to one of the most amazing condensation effects: so called "Prandtl-Glauert Condensation Clouds" caused by the rapid cooling of the air. You have to be really quick with your camera to capture it, as it only occurs at the exact moment of crossing the sonic barrier. This page has many photographs and videos of this phenomena.
A F/A-18F Super Hornet streaks past the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Kitty Hawk in the Philippine Sea:(U.S. Navy photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Jonathan Chandler, via)
Skilled pilots can actually control the exact position where such a cloud can appear: "it is possible to work the plane's throttle (controlling the airspeed) to move the shock wave forward or aft" -(images credit: Ensign John Gay, U.S. Navy)
As you can see on the left image above, the smaller shock wave appears over the cabin, as well... Here is an F-14 causing the effect, as it completes a super-sonic flyby (left) and F-22 Raptor on the right:(images credit: Jarod Hodge, Ronald Dejarnett, U.S. Navy)
Our reader Ian Woolard comments on this effect: "These weird clouds occur when the aircraft is moving at transonic speed - these are from about Mach 0.8 to Mach 1.2, and I suspect that none of these aircraft are actually going faster than Mach 1.0. There is a reason for this: the shapes are caused where the air is "temporarily" forced to speed up past the aircraft to supersonic speeds, but since the aircraft is moving below the speed of sound, no sonic boom reaches the ground."
You can clearly see wingtip vortices in this picture, as the VFA-94 (Fixed Wing Strike Fighter Squadron 94, also known as the "Mighty Shrikes") F/A-18C Hornets streak across the sky:(images credit: Mate 3rd Class Elizabeth Thompson, Mate 3rd Class Kristi J. Earl, U.S. Navy)
Some fighter jets don't even need any cloud effects to make them look cool... these are SAAB-35 Drakens showing impressive jet glow in the night:(images credit: Belgium Air Force Sgt. Dirk Voortmans, 2)There is a plane at the end of this rainbow!
Perhaps the most sublime effect of them all is the rainbow and shadow combination appearing in the sky, or on the clouds around a condensation trail of a passing jet: (image via)
This shot of rainbow contrails from Airbus A-340 has an ephemeral, almost surreal quality:(image credit: Jeff Well)

Heavenly Highways! -<br><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;" src="j40.jpg" alt=""><br><font size="1">(image via)</font><br><br><br><b>The Opposite of Contrails</b><br><br>
when the jet passes through a cloud, it is the absence of the trail (so called "distrail") that becomes visible - as the plane clears its way through the cloud, the turbulence and freezing of supercooled water droplets cause elongated trails, stretching for dozens of kilometers and even visible from space:<br><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;" src="j15.jpg" alt=""><br><font size="1">(images credit: NASA, via)</font><br><br>
"As an aircraft passes through the supercooled clouds (supercooled clouds contain water droplets that remain liquid even though the temperature is well below freezing), tiny particles in the exhaust come into contact with the supercooled water droplets, which freeze instantly. The larger ice crystals fall out of the cloud deck, leaving behind the "holes", while the tiniest ice particles in the center remain aloft." - more info<br><br><br><b>Propeller tip vortices swirl around the fuselage...</b><br><br>
There are other types of contrails besides those from the engine exhaust. Our reader writes: "I've seen and taken pictures of propeller-driven aircraft with contrails forming off the prop tips and wrapping themselves around the fuselage and nacelles of the aircraft for five or six spirals from the front of the aircraft/nacelle. This is usually in high ambient temperature/high humidity conditions."<br><br>
Propeller vortices could be just as interesting visually as wingtip vortices, but they're harder to spot and rare to occur: in this case they are clearly seen around the Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 Hercules C4:<br><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;" src="j27.jpg" alt=""><br><font size="1">(image credit: Sven De Bevere)</font><br><br><br><b>Breaking the Sound Barrier: Transonic Cloud Effects</b><br><br>
Going over the sound barrier leads to one of the most amazing condensation effects: so called "Prandtl-Glauert Condensation Clouds" caused by the rapid cooling of the air. You have to be really quick with your camera to capture it, as it only occurs at the exact moment of crossing the sonic barrier. This page has many photographs and videos of this phenomena.<br><br>
A F/A-18F Super Hornet streaks past the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Kitty Hawk in the Philippine Sea:<br><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;" src="j16.jpg" alt=""><br><font size="1">(U.S. Navy photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Jonathan Chandler, via)</font><br><br>
Skilled pilots can actually control the exact position where such a cloud can appear: "it is possible to work the plane's throttle (controlling the airspeed) to move the shock wave forward or aft" -<br><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;" src="j17.jpg" alt=""><br><font size="1">(images credit: Ensign John Gay, U.S. Navy)</font><br><br>
As you can see on the left image above, the smaller shock wave appears over the cabin, as well... Here is an F-14 causing the effect, as it completes a super-sonic flyby (left) and F-22 Raptor on the right:<br><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;" src="j20.jpg" alt=""><br><font size="1">(images credit: Jarod Hodge, Ronald Dejarnett, U.S. Navy)</font><br><br>
Our reader Ian Woolard comments on this effect: "These weird clouds occur when the aircraft is moving at transonic speed - these are from about Mach 0.8 to Mach 1.2, and I suspect that none of these aircraft are actually going faster than Mach 1.0. There is a reason for this: the shapes are caused where the air is "temporarily" forced to speed up past the aircraft to supersonic speeds, but since the aircraft is moving below the speed of sound, no sonic boom reaches the ground."<br><br>
You can clearly see wingtip vortices in this picture, as the VFA-94 (Fixed Wing Strike Fighter Squadron 94, also known as the "Mighty Shrikes") F/A-18C Hornets streak across the sky:<br><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;" src="j21.jpg" alt=""><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;" src="j22.jpg" alt=""><br><font size="1">(images credit: Mate 3rd Class Elizabeth Thompson, Mate 3rd Class Kristi J. Earl, U.S. Navy)</font><br><br>

Perhaps the most sublime effect of them all is the <b>rainbow and shadow combination</b> appearing in the sky, or on the clouds around a condensation trail of a passing jet: <br><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;" src="j23.jpg" alt=""><br><font size="1">(image via)</font><br><br>

This NASA video is called the "Evolution of the Moon", but we think that "heavy, brutal, merciless bombardment" will be better way to describe the epic cataclysmic events that shaped our Moon in the distant past.

------------Trilobites had full 360-degrees vision!(Walleserops found in Morocco - via the National Museum of Natural History, Robert M. Hazen)
As you all know, trilobites lived around 500 - 300 million years ago in Triassic period (the largest growing to the size of an umbrella). However, one fact about trilobites is even more amazing than their longevity - they roamed the oceans for all 270 million years!. The Trilobite eye is truly amazing instrument: it's the oldest eye we have on record, and also a very successful one - it gave trilobites a huge evolutionary edge compared to other species.
The most advanced species possessed compound eyes capable of 360-degree vision; what's more, their eyes were made of solid crystal! - more info. "The trilobite eye is composed of solid calcite crystals pack together."
Even more interesting is this peculiar columnar eye (complete with an eyeshade), discovered on one of the rare varieties of trilobite: "In September 2003 Fortey and Chatterton reported on a remarkable trilobite: Erbenochile erbeni, a Moroccan acastoid with an extremely well-developed schizochroal eye borne on tall, columnar palpebral lobes, rimmed with an eyeshade."(images via)
"Trilobite scientists now conclude that trilobites “possessed the most sophisticated eye lenses ever produced,” and their vision may actually have “been superior to current living animals”...
If you think that nothing resembling trilobites survives today, think again - Notostraca family are true living fossils, changed little since the Jurassic period (approximately 180 million years ago)! Here is a specimen found in Chelyabinsk, Siberia, of the Triops kind:(images via)
And then there are horseshoe crabs... Seems like "Trilobite doppelgangers" are all around us:(image via)

------------<br><br><b>Trilobites had full 360-degrees vision!</b><br><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px; width:900px" src="ewrgfqwefsdfsdfsdfsdfsdf.jpg" alt=""><br><font size="1">(<i>Walleserops</i> found in Morocco - via the National Museum of Natural History, Robert M. Hazen)</font><br><br>
As you all know, trilobites lived around 500 - 300 million years ago in Triassic period (the largest growing to the size of an umbrella). However, one fact about trilobites is even more amazing than their longevity - they roamed the oceans for all 270 million years!. The Trilobite eye is truly amazing instrument: it's the oldest eye we have on record, and also a very successful one - it gave trilobites a huge evolutionary edge compared to other species.<br><br>
The most advanced species possessed compound eyes capable of 360-degree vision; what's more, their eyes were made of solid crystal! - more info. "The trilobite eye is composed of solid calcite crystals pack together."<br><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;" src="w4eqefdsfsdfsdfsdf.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
Even more interesting is this peculiar columnar eye (complete with an eyeshade), discovered on one of the rare varieties of trilobite: "In September 2003 Fortey and Chatterton reported on a remarkable trilobite: <i>Erbenochile erbeni</i>, a Moroccan acastoid with an extremely well-developed schizochroal eye borne on tall, columnar palpebral lobes, rimmed with an eyeshade."<br><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;" src="ewrfqewfdsfsdfsdfsdfsf.jpg" alt=""><br><font size="1">(images via)</font><br><br>
"Trilobite scientists now conclude that trilobites “possessed the most sophisticated eye lenses ever produced,” and their vision may actually have “been superior to current living animals”...<br><br>
If you think that nothing resembling trilobites survives today, think again - Notostraca family are true living fossils, changed little since the Jurassic period (approximately 180 million years ago)! Here is a specimen found in Chelyabinsk, Siberia, of the Triops kind:<br><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;" src="wegfqewfdsfsdfsdfsdf.jpg" alt=""><br><font size="1">(images via)</font><br><br>
And then there are horseshoe crabs... Seems like "Trilobite doppelgangers" are all around us:<br><br><img style="margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;" src="wqe4tfrqwfdsfdsfsdfsdfsdf.jpg" alt=""><br><font size="1">(image via)</font><br><br>
